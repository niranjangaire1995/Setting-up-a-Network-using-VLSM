### Practical Implementation Process

1. I plugged all Ethernet and console cables into their respective ports.
2. Console cables were connected to all switches and routers, then linked to a PC for configuration.
3. I opened **Device Manager** to identify COM ports used by each switch and router (e.g., COM12, COM15, etc.).
4. Using **PuTTY**, I selected the appropriate COM ports and opened separate sessions for each device to begin configuration.
5. On each PC, I navigated to **Network Configuration Settings** and manually assigned the IP address and subnet mask.

6. I assigned IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways on all switches.
7. Disabled unused ports on the switches to enhance security.
8. Configured the IP addresses on all three interfaces of each router as per the subnet plan.
9. **Only OSPF** was used for dynamic routing—**EIGRP was not used**.
10. Configured **SSH access** on both routers and switches for secure remote management.
11. Verified full connectivity by pinging all devices from each PC—ping tests were successful.
12. Successfully accessed routers and switches remotely using SSH from different PCs.
